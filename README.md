# Hi ðŸ‘‹! 

### Welcome to the **jrnowl** organization page

Please keep all your JRNL-related repos under this organization and private whenever possible.  
This organization could become the central point for managing our collective efforts by logging issues and progress; please let me know how you feel about adopting this in our workflow.

Eventually we can store all our shared info here, like api keys and other account details.
